we took a list of 79 derived morphemes (26 prefixes and 53 suffixes) in English and found all types that occur in the Glove corpus. We then extracted the underived forms of each type and searched to see if the underived form exists in the corpus. If it does, then we include these pairs as a type candidate for the morpheme. For example, for the morpheme re-, we find "reapply" and search to see if "apply" exists in the corpus. If found, we include it in the candidate list. These candidates were then filtered by a human to capture true morphologically related pairs. We excluded examples such as (transat, at).
