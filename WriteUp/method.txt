we took a list of 79 derived morphemes (26 prefixes and 53 suffixes) in English and found all types that occur in the Glove corpus. We then extracted the underived forms of each type and searched to see if the underived form exists in the corpus. If it does, then we include these pairs as a type candidate for the morpheme. For example, for the morpheme re-, we find "reapply" and search to see if "apply" exists in the corpus. If found, we include it in the candidate list. These candidates were then filtered by a human to capture true morphologically related pairs. We excluded examples such as (transat, at).

There are at least three levels:

1) Clearly not connected. We got rid of these:  


		clear semantic unrelatedness

			pro-statehood and prostate

			imaged	aged

			corner corn

2) Somewhat connected, but complicated:

	a)Difficulty with semantic similarity:

		entail tail

		impound pound

		organist organ

		impound is related to a very constrained reading of pound. Do we want to 
		keep it?




	b)Hierarchical representation and level ordering -- underived versus derived

		importers versus porters

	c) Same surface representations, but two underlying possible forms:

		darker dark 	versus 	player	play

		happier happy	versus	bombardier bombard

3) Clearly Semantically Related:

	enjoin	join
	

Another issue:

	The word vectors are not lemmatized, so inflectional forms of same root are 
	different vectors:

	enjoin
	enjoined
	enjoins

	This problem does not exist with suffixes, because English inflection is on the 
	left. 


Idea:

	It's not frequency relations that predict productivity, but semantic form coherence -- exmplar


	Kurdistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.

	The underived forms are probably fairly uncommon, but it should be really productive in a very constrained context. Semantically very uniform in English. Exmplar is well defined --> will be used more easily
